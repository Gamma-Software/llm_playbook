# Telegram
This integration is pretty simple and free to use. There is a library `python-telegram-bot` that handles all the heavy lifting for us.

# WhatsApp
For now I did not find any free way to do this. This is owned by Meta and is priced based. There is an official API but no python library known. Maybe this one `https://pypi.org/project/python-whatsapp-bot/` can be used but it's not complete.
